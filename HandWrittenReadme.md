`Note:  This is a purely Human Written Readme I Know there are lots of spelling and grammar mistakes so you can chekcout original README.md. If you are interested in human written README then be my guest.`

Hello **Everyone** , Hope everyone doing awesome . 
Today i bought you a new  topic to dicuss on that App routing in Next.JS .

So just to be clear if you have clicked on this blog . That means you have either started working with Next.Js or looking to start with it . without any a due we will begin this.

So i will be creating an example webpage  `routing-example` to better understand the routing .

## Why do you need need routing ?

So whenever you visit a website . There will be navbar in the top . so using that you can navigate to various pages of the website . Even in a static page like Landing or anything this is a comman practice . So this becomes easy for the end user to easily or directly access the page .

## Different Types of Routing in Next.Js 

There are basicallly 2 types of Next.Js routing
1. App Routing ( Very Common and standard Pratice)
2. Page Routing

So in page routing , it will not have `app` folder structure and a `pages` folder is created and inside that each page is given names for each route 
For Example if you want to go to `/about` .Then in the main folder staructure create a folder `pages` and inside that you create `about.tsx` or `about.jsx` page . But this is now outdated and is replaced by `App Router`

We will see more about using `App Router` below with an example

## Setting up Next.JS Application

So make sure you have node and npm installed in you system and make sure it is the latest one too .

And then install create-next-app using command 
```bash
npm install create-next-app@latest
```

and then to create a new Next.Js application use command 

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest routing-example
```
And then it will ask for some setting choose below setting 
**TypeScript** - **Yes**   
**ESLint** - **Yes**  
**TailWind CSS** - **Yes** (As per your requirement)  
**src/ directory** - **Yes**   
**App Router** - **Yes** (This is important and compulsory for using App router.)

Your setting will look like below image 

Now open the application in `VS Code` ( Just because i love this editor ðŸ˜‚) . 

In the same command folder where you created the application 

you can do below command

```bash
cd routing-example
```

and to start the application use below command 
```bash
npm run dev 
```

and then you can go to `localhost:3000` to check the boiler plate web page .

First step to do is remove all unwanted code in page.tsx and just keep below code 


`src/app/page.tsx`
```js

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      Hello world 
      Main Page
    </div>
  );
}

```

And Now for Checking with routing we can we simple navbar 

Create a new folder `Components` inside `src/app` and inside the folder add new file as **Navbar.tsx** and the folder structure will look like below

Add below code inside the page `Navbar.tsx`

`src/app/Components/Navbar.tsx`
```js
// components/Navbar.tsx
"use client"
import Link from 'next/link';

const Navbar: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <nav style={styles.navbar}>
      <ul style={styles.navList}>
        <li>
          <Link href="/" legacyBehavior>
            <a style={styles.link}>Home</a>
          </Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link href="/about" legacyBehavior>
            <a style={styles.link}>About</a>
          </Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link href="/contact" legacyBehavior>
            <a style={styles.link}>Contact</a>
          </Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link href="/input" legacyBehavior>
            <a style={styles.link}>Input Name</a>
          </Link>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  );
};

const styles = {
  navbar: {
    padding: '1rem',
    backgroundColor: '#333',
  },
  navList: {
    listStyleType: 'none',
    display: 'flex',
    gap: '1rem',
  },
  link: {
    color: '#fff',
    textDecoration: 'none',
  },
};

export default Navbar;

```

And now inside the page `src\app\layout.tsx` you have to add navbar since navbar is common in all pages . Add it above {children} line .

`src\app\layout.tsx`

```js
import type { Metadata } from "next";
import localFont from "next/font/local";
import "./globals.css";
import Navbar from "./Components/Navbar";

const geistSans = localFont({
  src: "./fonts/GeistVF.woff",
  variable: "--font-geist-sans",
  weight: "100 900",
});
const geistMono = localFont({
  src: "./fonts/GeistMonoVF.woff",
  variable: "--font-geist-mono",
  weight: "100 900",
});

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Create Next App",
  description: "Generated by create next app",
};

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body
        className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}
      >
         <Navbar />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Okay now to check the Code you can go to `localhost:3000` and voila navbar should be visible . But if you try to click on any navbar option it will give me **404 Error** bcz we havent yet configured or created those pages .

So to start with we can start with **Contact Page**

## App routing for Contact Page

So in next Js . For creation of routing in App Routing . The main page is **page.tsx** in each folder . 

So if we want to create a route like `localhost:3000/contact` we need to create a folder inside `src/app` named `contact` so make sure the **name of the folder is same as route name** . And inside the `contact` folder create a `page.tsx` and make sure the file is named as same otherwise it will not work .

So now the folder structure will look like
```
src
 |-> app
      |-> contact
             |-> page.tsx
```
So above folder structure need to be followed strictly

And now inside `src/app/contact/page.tsx` add below code (Since this is just a demo example I am keeping a small code)

`src/app/contact/page.tsx`
```js

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
     This is the Contact Page
    </div>
  );
}

```

So now you can test it out .

Go to `localhost:3000` . In the Navbar click on the **contact** item and it will load the contact page like below . If it not loading please check the Folder structure properly.

**So now you can follow same steps for about page also**

So this approach is awesome for loading static pages .
Now what about dynamic routes. What if the route is changing based on the value . For example profile pages of a individual . It will different based on username .

No worries Next.Js has us covered in that part also .

## Dynamic App Routing in Next.Js

We will create a page where we will input a name and when submitted it will show a welcome message based on that name . 

So For Dynamic routing the main thing is value which is passed in route for example .

Let us consider username in github profile link `https://github.com/Varshithvhegde` . In this case `/Varshithvhegde` is a dynamic route . So to create a folder structure for a dynamic route we can use something called `[username].tsx` and **you can replace username with anything you want**

We can get started with example :
So in this case we need a page for entering a input so we need to create `src/app/input/page.tsx` so we can get rout `localhost:3000/input`

`src/app/input/page.tsx`
```js
"use client";
import { useState } from "react";
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";

const NamePage: React.FC = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useState<string>("");
  const router = useRouter();

  const handleInputChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    setName(e.target.value);
  };

  const handleSubmit = () => {
    router.push("/input/" + name);
  };

  return (
    <div style={styles.container}>
      <h1 style={styles.heading}>Enter Your Name</h1>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={name}
        onChange={handleInputChange}
        placeholder="Type your name"
        style={styles.input}
      />
      <button type="button" onClick={handleSubmit} style={styles.button}>
        Submit
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

const styles = {
  container: {
    display: 'flex',
    flexDirection: 'column',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    height: "100vh",
    backgroundColor: "#f4f4f4",
  },
  heading: {
    marginBottom: "1rem",
    fontSize: "24px",
    color: "#333",
  },
  input: {
    padding: "0.5rem 1rem",
    fontSize: "16px",
    borderRadius: "5px",
    border: "1px solid #ccc",
    width: "200px",
    marginBottom: "1rem",
  },
  button: {
    padding: "0.5rem 1rem",
    fontSize: "16px",
    backgroundColor: "#0070f3",
    color: "#fff",
    border: "none",
    borderRadius: "5px",
    cursor: "pointer",
    transition: "background-color 0.3s ease",
  },
};

export default NamePage;

```

So No need to worry about the code . It has a input for entering the name and then a submit button . And instead of using `<Link/>` we are use `useRouter()` to handle the navigation programmatically. `useState()` is used to hold the value of the name . 

But still it is not completed we havn't created page to get the value of the **name** that you submitted .

So for dynamic routing we need to create a new folder inside `input` folder and also place a `page.tsx` as `[name]/page.tsx`

So the folder structure now look like 

```
src
 |-> app
      |-> contact
             |-> page.tsx
      |-> input
             |-> page.tsx
             |-> [name]
                    |->page.tsx
    
```

Make sure the folder is named as `[name]` itself for this example you can give any name but the same changes need to done in below code itself

`src/app/input/[name]/page.tsx`

```js
export default function Name({ params }: { params: { name: string } }) {
    return (
      <div style={styles.container}>
        <div style={styles.card}>
          <h1 style={styles.heading}>Hello, {params.name}!</h1>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
  
  const styles = {
    container: {
      display: 'flex',
      justifyContent: 'center',
      alignItems: 'center',
      height: '90vh',
      backgroundColor: '#f0f0f5',  // light background color
    },
    card: {
      padding: '2rem 3rem',
      backgroundColor: '#fff',
      borderRadius: '10px',
      boxShadow: '0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)',  // subtle shadow for depth
      textAlign: 'center',
    },
    heading: {
      fontSize: '36px',
      fontWeight: 'bold',
      color: '#333',
      margin: 0,
    },
  };
  
```

So to get teh value from the route we are using `params` so in the code `name : string` the **name** should be same as the folder name **[name]** . So for example , if you create folder as **[username]** then in the code you need to change it as `username : string` keep this in mind .


So Now for testing part . 
 Go to `localhost:3000` . And in the Nav bar click on item `Input Name`  it will take you to `http://localhost:3000/input` and there will be option to input your name . So just type in your name and then click on Submit .

 VoilÃ  !!!

 For example if you inputted **Varshith**
 then in the URL you can see `http://localhost:3000/input/Varshith` and also it will show the name in the page itself .

 Below is the screenshot of full folder structure .

 I have published the code in the github so you can checkout there also `https://github.com/Varshithvhegde/routing-example`
